# About this repo

This repo contains the first of five required solo projects from freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries course.
It is a quoteMachine which uses "The One API" for creating quotes from the lord of the rings. 
I built the project on my own using react. (It might be a little bit overengineered, but I wanted to try out different techniques I learned at severalt tutorials in a small scope).
